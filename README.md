# four-in-a-row
Simple four in a row game that implements server/ciient design.

I'm remaking this game using server/client programming so that two players can play in two different computers.
The project uses Nodejs, Express and socket.io for the server and sockets management. The information is web served and clients can play in their browsers.
On the client side, the information is displayed using the p5.js library.
